        <h3>Armrest for Stroke and TBI Patients</h3>
        <img class="project1-img" src="armrest.png" alt="The Adjust armrest created for stroke and TBI patients.">
        <p>
            Stroke and TBI patients often experience paralysis or weakness on one side of their body, which can
            lead to poor posture and shoulder subluxation if not treated correctly. Our client, Courtney Celian
            of the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab, asked us to design a wheelchair armrest that is easy to use, stable,
            and useful in the rehabilitation of stroke and TBI patients.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Adjust-a-ball Armrest is a padded arm-trough with an elbow-fitted back, mounted atop a
            locking ball and socket joint that is secured by cushion u-bolts to the wheelchair frame. Our design
            meets three main requirements that we established through research, interviews, and testing: ease of use,
            secure attachment, and aid in rehabilitation.

        <h3>Breathe Easy: The DIY PEEP Device</h3>
        <img class="project2-img" src="peep.png" alt="The Breathe Easy PEEP device.">
        <p>
            The Breathe Easy is a PEEP device that delivers positive pressure to neonatal patients in a cost effective
            and easy-to-produce manner. This device consists of three main components: the breathing tube, the bottle
            itself, and the bottle stability device. In an effort to solve existing problems in the current design used
            in the Mulago Hospital in Uganda, our team focused our efforts on improvements in two areas: an all-inclusive
            and reusable bottle cap and a bottle pouch for stability.
        </p>
        <p>
            The bottle cap enables reusability of a built-in breathing tube and provides stability to the tube and pressure,
            in addition to a zip tie ruler that can measure the depth of the breathing tube in the water. The bottle pouch
            ensures that the bottle cannot easily be knocked over.
